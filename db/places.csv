1,Desa ParkCity,Park,"Desa Parkcity, 52200 Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Kepong,Malaysia,1,"Desa ParkCity, Kuala Lumpur, covering 473 acres of prime freehold land, is one of the fastest growing and best-selling master planned communities in the nation.

Located in the affluent north-western district of Kuala Lumpur, Desa ParkCity is a place where people live, work and play.

Major highways (such as the LDP Highway, the Middle Ring Road 2 and the Penchala Link) provide quick and convenient access to important destinations in Kuala Lumpur and its surroundings.

Located about 13 kilometers from the city center of Kuala Lumpur, Desa ParkCity is just 35 minutes from the city center, 15 minutes from Mont Kiara, 20 minutes from Damansara Heights and 25 minutes to the Petaling Jaya conurbation.

Transformed from an abandoned quarry site, Desa ParkCity is the first-of-its-kind New Urbanist community in Malaysia in which concepts of community, public places and neighborhood conveniences converge to make residents’ everyday living special and rewarding.

Desa ParkCity’s design philosophy embraces the ideal that people want to foster family, neighborhood and community ties and values as a means to shape a good society, and a sense of place so that the individual and the family will not be lost in the rapidly expanding metropolis of Kuala Lumpur city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Gunung Nuang,Trail,"Gunung Nuang, Hulu Langat, Selangor, Malaysia",Hulu Langat,Malaysia,3,"Gunung Nuang is the highest mountain of Selangor, at 1,493m with trails that start from either Hulu Langat, Janda Baik (Bukit Tinggi) or Kemensah (Gombak, near Kuala Lumpur). The most popular route is through Hulu Langat, and it is not uncommon to see the trail overrun by people on weekends. For the moderately fit, the duration to reach the peak is a deceptive four to five hours, but only when dry. Significant rainfall will turn major portions of the trail into a mudbath - a demoralising scramble up steep gradients with little traction. Hiking turns to a crawl, and if on the way back, expect heavy segments of sliding.

Many non-seasoned visitors will turn back at this point, if not already at the peak. To climb Nuang using the main route, follow directions towards Hulu Langat on the Cheras highway from Kuala Lumpur. Once you hit the trunk road, follow signboards towards Pangsoon until the entrance of a dam; the trail starts from a park at left. A small fee of MYR1 is levied by the Orang Asli gatekeeper here on weekends. The first part of the climb is an undulating gravel and dirt road walk to reach the foothill. Fringed by secondary growth and bamboo, it's a boring experience with little sights along the way. After an hour, the trail leads into proper jungle, passing through campsites with stream crossings until a steep run all the way up to Puncak Pengasih. From this check-point, the trail is more level until the summit, where a pretty view of mountains, and even Kuala Lumpur and Genting Highlands, await on a clear day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,KL Forest Eco Park,Trail,"Hutan Simpan Bukit Nanas, Jalan Raja Chulan, Kuala Lumpur, 50250 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,2,"Although KL Forest Eco Park is one of the oldest permanent forest reserves in Malaysia it now boasts one of Kuala Lumpur’s latest attractions, an impressive 200m canopy walk, providing visitors with a wonderful aerial view of the treetops and the city beyond.

Previously known as Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve, this park is the only remaining stretch of tropical rainforest within the city limits of KL.

It was gazetted as a permanent forest reserve in 1906 and at that time it had an area of 17.5 hectares. Urban development, including construction of the KL Tower in the 1990’s, has nibbled away at the reserve over the years and now only 9 hectares remains.

Nine hectares is still a good size and the park contains some fine specimens of lowland dipterocarp and non-dipterocarp trees including some endangered and threatened species such as Kapur (camphor) and Karas (source of agar wood). As well as bringing some fresh air to the city centre, the park is a refuge for birdlife and wildlife, mostly monkeys and small mammals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
